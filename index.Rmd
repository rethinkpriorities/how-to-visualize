# How to Visualize {-}

## Important {-}

This is a work in progress! At this point I would not even call it an alpha, so please be patient while we finalize this book!

## About {-}

This is a book to organize our knowledge of data visualization and to provide examples, code, templates, and functions that can be used across various Rethink Priorities projects.

There are several important goals we're hoping to achieve with this book:

1. Establish a knowledge base about how to best represent different types of data and relationships
2. Provide examples of code that can be adjusted and incorporated to suit common data visualization needs^[And 'graph and table-making functions' that can be simply applied without clutter.]
3. Establish different color palettes that can be consistently used within and between Rethink Priorities projects
4. Be inclusive by designing responsive and color-blind friendly graphs
5. Build this bookdown as an 'example template' for our other bookdown work
