## About {-}

This is a book to organize our knowledge of data visualization and to provide example code that can be reused in various Rethink Priorities projects.

There are several important goals we're hoping to achieve with this book:

1. Establish a knowledge base about how to best represent different types of data
2. Provide examples of code that can be copy-pasted and adjusted to suit common data visualization needs
3. Establish different color palettes that can be consistently used within and between Rethink Priorities projects
4. Be inclusive by designing responsive and color-blind friendly graphs

If you have feedback, please contact any of the people below or create an issue
on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/how-to-visualize/issues).
