Scatter plots are useful to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables. If this is indeed the goal of the graph, it is useful to also plot a line that summarizes the relationship.

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    alpha = .25,
    color = "black"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
