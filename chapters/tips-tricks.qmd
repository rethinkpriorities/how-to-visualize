This chapter is about a few random things that may come in handy when creating plots. There are a few things that you probably always have to Google to remind yourself how to do it. This chapter is about those kinds of things.

## Removing the legend

You can remove the legend by using the `guides()` element. Simply set the aesthetic that you don't want a legend of to `"none"`.

```{r}
#| label: remove-legend-1
data <- tibble(x = 1:5, y = 1:5)
ggplot(data, aes(x, y, fill = factor(x))) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme_minimal()
```
