*Note: this is a placeholder for now.*

I intend to integrate the content found starting [HERE](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/methodology-statistics-design/presentation.html#case-relative-shares-of-a-total-e.g.-shares-of-ea-population-by-referrer-or-donation-totals-by-country), as well as further visualisation content from EAS work.

```{r wppage}

knitr::include_url("https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#summary-charts")

```
