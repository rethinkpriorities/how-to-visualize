# Best practices

## `ggplot`

Aim to use the `ggplot` R package for creating plots. `ggplot` is a powerful visualization package and should enable us to create the kind of plots we want to present. If we all use `ggplot`, we can write code that can be re-used by each other. It also makes it easy to write custom themes and color palettes that can be re-used, which will produce a consistency within and between projects that people are likely to appreciate.

## Labeling

Use readable but concise labels. Examples of good labels are:

- "Amount donated"
- "GWWC" (we can assume people know what GWWC is)

Examples of bad labels are:

- amt_don
