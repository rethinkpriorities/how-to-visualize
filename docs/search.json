If we all use ggplot, we can write code that can be re-used by each other. It also makes it easy to write custom themes and color palettes that can be re-used, which will produce a consistency within and between projects that people are likely to appreciate.\nAlways save the plot as an object in the environment as well as printing it where it belongs.\n‘Piping data into the ggplot’ to make the code more portable and readable.

Although it is easy to create a simple bar plot, there are several things that can be done to improve on them:\n\nIf there are multiple categories, use a fill to further emphasize that the data represents different categories. Also think about which color to use and the ordering of the colors to best represent the data.\nOrder the categories in terms of their frequency\nAdd frequency labels to make it easier to see the exact frequencies\n\nThere are two basic ways to construct a bar plot in ggplot. The first way is to use the raw data and have ggplot calculate the frequencies.\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(class)), fill = class)) +\n  geom_bar(alpha = .85) +\n  geom_text(\n    stat = \"count\",\n    mapping = aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n    vjust = -0.5,\n    color = \"grey20\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"class\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    option = \"mako\", \n    begin = .05, \n    end = .95\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to flip the order from high to low, remove the fct_rev() function from the code.\nThe second way is to first calculate the frequencies yourself and then use the resulting data frame to plot the frequencies.\n\nCodecounts <- count(mpg, class)\n\nggplot(counts, aes(x = reorder(class, n), y = n, fill = class)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = .85) +\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(label = n),\n    vjust = -0.5,\n    color = \"grey20\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"class\", y = \"count\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"mako\", end = .95) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Percentages\nIf you want to plot percentages instead, you can use the same two techniques as before: 1) have ggplot calculate the percentages or 2) do it yourself first.\nIf you want to have ggplot calculate a percentage, you can use ..count../sum(..count..).\n\nCodeggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(class)), fill = class)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), alpha = .85) +\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(\n      label = percent(after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n      y = after_stat(count/sum(count))\n    ), \n    stat = \"count\", \n    vjust = -.5,\n    color = \"grey20\"\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"class\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE, \n    option = \"mako\", \n    begin = .05, \n    end = .95\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you calculate the percentages yourself first.\n\nCodecounts <- mpg %>%\n  count(class) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n / sum(n))\n\nggplot(counts, aes(x = reorder(class, n), y = pct, fill = class)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = .85) +\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(label = percent(pct)),\n    vjust = -0.5,\n    color = \"grey20\",\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"class\", y = \"count\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"mako\", end = .95) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe code of this latter approach seems to be a lot simpler, so could be recommended on that basis.\n\n2.1.2 Stacked bar plots\nStacked bar plots can be used to add additional information to a bar plot, but they generally are difficult to interpret. It’s difficult to assess the varying sizes of the stacked bar charts. Plotting Likert responses as a stacked bar char may be an exception, as long as it is accompanied by labeled percentages and rotated horizontally. See the Likert chapter for more information.\nUsually the better way to add additional information to a bar plot is to use faceting."

Improvements to a standard bar plot can consist of plotting percentages on top of each bar and plotting the numeric Likert response options (e.g., 1 to 5) on the x-axis together with a legend that contains the response labels. This way you don’t run into issues with the labels being too long to place on the x-axis and you’re also explicit about how Likert responses are often treated as numeric values (rather than categorical values).\n\nCode# Filter one item from the 'items' data frame\ninteresting <- filter(items, item == \"I find math interesting.\")\n\n# Calculate counts and proportions\ninteresting_counts <- interesting %>%\n  group_by(response) %>%\n  summarize(\n    response_num = first(response_num),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n / sum(n))\n\nggplot(interesting_counts, aes(x = response_num, y = pct, fill = response)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = .85) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(label = paste0(round(pct * 100), \"%\")), \n    vjust = -0.5, \n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = '\"I find math interesting.\"', \n    y = \"Percentage of respondents\", \n    fill = \"Categories\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"mako\", begin = .05, end = .95) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")"

To improve that interpretability, it helps to put labels on each segment of the stacked bar chart, flip the bars horizontally, and align the bars so it is easier to see where most responses lie.
